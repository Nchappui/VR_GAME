# VR_GAME

## How to launch the game

Once the computer is turned on, you must also turn on:
1. the VR headset along with the base stations
2. The treadmill

Three applications must be turned on:<br/>
1. Steam VR (this should look like that)<br/>

2. VIVE Wireless (this should look like that)<br/>

Once everything is turned on, you need to open Unity Hub and select VR GAME

Then go to Scenes and The Escape V.2:

Now Uniy is set up and the only things you need to do is to have the player on the treadmill, attach him to the ceilling using the harness and turn on one of the captors in his back (the light of the captor should turn green) and make sure that it is detected in the InfinaDeck application.

Once everything is done, you can click start on the InfinaDeck application and hit play on Unity

If the player is moving on the treadmill but his chararcter isn't moving in game, you can restart all the softwares mentionned above and retry.


## To launch the OpenWorld directly
Instead of opening the scene The Escape V.2, open the scene OpenWorld:
